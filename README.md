# STM32L152C-DISCO
How to get startet with the STM32L132C-DISCO board by STMicroelectronics.

For programming the STM32L152C-DISCO board, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 
is required.

STMicroelectronic recommendes the "System Workbench for STM32".

The following link is to my shared onedrive-folder, where the download for the "SW4STM32 System Workbench for STM32" is.

This IDE is Eclipse based and totally free.
